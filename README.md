### Scripts for Lightning Network snapshots reconstruction and geocoding.

These are the scripts associated with a data paper on the Lightning Network snapshots reconstruction and georeferencing. The folder contains several scripts representing a complete pipline. All figures from the paper can be reproduced using `misc/view.ipynb`.

Scripts must be executed in the sequence specified in the table bellow. Input data, temporary data and final data must be stored in the `data` folder until the scripts are finished.


| Stage     |Scripts           |
|:----------|:-----------------|
| 1. Data acquisition | 1. `download.py` |
| 2. Network graph reconstruction | 2. `slice.py` |
| 3. Pre-processing and consistency control | 3. `shapes.py` <br/> 4. `clean.py` |
| 4. Geocoding | 5. `addresses.py` <br/> 6. `geocode.py` <br/> 7. `geograph.py` |
